I am a social scientist with a methodological focus in remote sensing and the environmental sciences. My research focus is on mitigation and adaptation to the impacts of climate change, especially among farmers in low income regions. Recent projects center on migration and the environment's impact on long- and short- term decision making in Afghanstan and Brazil. I have worked with the World Bank, UNHCR, and [Development Innovation Lab at UChicago](https://dil.uchicago.edu/). I hold a Masters in Public Policy with Certificate in Research Methods from the University of Chicago and a Bachelors in Agricultural and Consumer Economics from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
